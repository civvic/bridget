    "> Notebook state +FastHTML + HTMX in Jupyter, no server required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bridget brings rich, server-free interactive HTML components to Jupyter notebooks using **FastHTML** and **HTMX**. It provides dynamic access to the notebook's state and aims to replicate much of `ipywidgets`' functionality with simpler, HTML-based components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook state includes its structure, cell content, outputs, and metadata, all captured live as you work without needing to save the file. This enables powerful introspection and allows tools to read and react to notebook contents in real time.\n"

    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serverless HTMX + FastHTML**: full FastHTML + HTMX functionality in Jupyter environments, with no HTTP server required.\n",
    "- **Extended FastHTML routing system**: integrates seamlessly with Python methods.\n",
    "- **Widget system (WIP)**: build UI components with minimal JavaScript.\n",
    "- **Real-time notebook introspection**: capture the full notebook structure dynamically, without `.ipynb` files.\n",
    "- **Environment-agnostic**: supports VSCode, JupyterLab, and other interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bridget relies on companion extensions for JupyterLab/Notebook and VSCode/Cursor. These capture the live notebook state and feed it directly to Bridget's Python kernel.\n"

    "## Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bridge\n",
    "The `Bridge` class ([14_bridge.ipynb](14_bridge.ipynb)) provides the low-level communication layer between Python and JavaScript, replacing the HTTP transport layer typically used by HTMX.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bridget and get_app()\n",
    "The `Bridget` class ([32_bridget.ipynb](32_bridget.ipynb)) and `get_app()` function provide the high-level API for creating interactive components. This is your main entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Routing System\n",
    "Bridget extends FastHTML's routing system ([04_route_provider.ipynb](04_route_provider.ipynb)) to work with Python methods and class instances, enabling stateful components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plugin System\n",
    "Bridget's functionality can be extended through plugins ([16_bridge_plugins.ipynb](16_bridge_plugins.ipynb)), enabling modular feature development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook State\n",
    "Access live notebook structure and content ([21_nb_state.ipynb](21_nb_state.ipynb)) without saving files, enabling powerful introspection capabilities.\n"
